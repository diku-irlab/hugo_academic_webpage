The Information Retrieval Lab is a team of faculty, research scientists, programmers and students who work together on models and algorithms that allow computers to process and make inferences about human language text. 

Our work is in the areas of information retrieval, data mining and applied machine learning (mainly for web data), with applications to search engines, recommender systems, plagiarism detection, opinion/sentiment mining, and text analytics, and with particular emphasis to large-scale web data.
