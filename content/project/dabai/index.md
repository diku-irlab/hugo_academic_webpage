Our main hypothesis is that uses of algorithm techniques and algorithm engineering can contribute to obtaining the required efficiency for effective Big Data analysis tools both in the other core areas and in the domains. Thus research questions will center around engineering algorithms techniques in the domains and integrating techniques in the core area.
